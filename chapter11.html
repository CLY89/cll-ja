<h2 id='11__'>第11章: 出来事、質、量やその他のあいまいな言葉: ロジバンにおける抽象化について</h2>

<h3 id='s1'>1. 抽象化の文法</h3>

<p>ロジバンに「抽象化」の仕組みが導入されたのは、 ブリディ全体をひとまとめにして、1つのセルブリであるかのように扱う手段を提供するためである。抽象化の文法は単純で規則的だが、それによって表せる内容は複雑で豊かなものとなっている。1つ1つの抽象化の種類はそれぞれ別の機能を受け持っており、重なりは少ない。ここではまず文法に焦点をしぼって説明を始める。表せる意味内容について全体像が見えるまでは、抽象化を使う意味が感じられないかもしれないがまずは<a href='#s2'>第2節</a>までお付き合いいただきたい。</p>

<p>抽象化セルブリを作るには、ブリディをまるまる1つ持ってきて、NU類のシマヴォをどれでもよいので1つ先頭に付ければよい。そうしたシマヴォは全部で12個あり、「抽象詞」と呼ぶ。さらにこのブリディはKEI類の省略可能な終端詞、keiで閉じられる。つまり以下のブリディを</p>

<pre id='e1d1'><code>1.1)  mi klama le zarci
    私はその店に行く。</code></pre>

<p>NU類の1つ、nuを使った抽象化に変換するには</p>

<pre id='e1d2'><code>1.2)  nu mi klama le zarci [kei]
    私がその店に行くという出来事</code></pre>

<p>とすればよい。ブリディは単純にセルブリだけでもよいし、上の例のようにスムティ付きでもよい。keiを不用意に省略することには注意が必要だ。多くの抽象化セルブリの用法では、もしkeiが省略されていたら抽象化の一部ともなり得るような単語が後に続いていることが多いからである。</p>

<p>(厳密には、keiは常に省略可能である。というのも一般的なブリディを閉じる省略可能な終端詞vauで代用できるからである。しかし、keiは抽象化に限定された終端詞であり、keiを使う方がほとんどの場合より意味が明確になる。)</p>

<p>抽象化セルブリの文法的用法は、単純なブリヴラとまったく同じである。特に、抽象化セルブリは<a href='#e1d2'>例1.2</a>のように観察文として使うことができる。次の例ではタンルに使われている:</p>

<pre id='e1d3'><code>1.3)  la djan. cu nu sonci kei djica
    ジョンは兵隊でありたいと望む。</code></pre>

<p>抽象化セルブリは、le (やその他のLE類)を先頭に付けることで、描写としても使うことができる:</p>

<pre id='e1d4'><code>1.4)  la djan. cu djica le nu sonci [kei]
    ジョンは兵隊であるという出来事を望む。</code></pre>

<p>抽象化を含む描写は多くの場合ブリディの終わりか、主体となるセルブリとそのcuの直前に置くことになる。このどちらの場合でも、keiは通常省略可能になる。</p>

<p>抽象化セルブリの場所構造は使われている抽象詞によって異なる。詳しくは後で個々の抽象詞と一緒に説明しよう。</p>

<p>注: 抽象化の中のブリディについては、訳語の文法をそれと分かるように変えている。そのため、<a href='#e1d2'>例1.2</a>では「私はその店に行く」ではなく「私がその店に行くという出来事」となる。同様に、<a href='#e1d3'>例1.3</a>と<a href='#e1d4'>例1.4</a>でも「兵隊である」ではなく「兵隊であること」となっている。この訳し方は、より分かりやすい訳をという意図の反映であり、ロジバン側の文法上の違いを示すものではない。ブリディはブリディであり、抽象化セルブリの中であっても変化することはない。</p>

<h3 id='s2'>2. 出来事の抽象化</h3>

<p>この節では以下のシマヴォを解説する:</p>

<pre><code>nu  NU  出来事の抽象詞</code></pre>

<p><a href='#s1'>第1節</a>の例では、抽象詞として最も一般的なnuを使った。その役割は、ブリディ全体で表される出来事や状態を1つの枠に収めることにある。ここで、nu抽象詞を用いたledescription_sumti(?)と、leのみを用いたdescription_sumti(?)を混同しないように注意したい。以下のスムティはそれぞれ違う意味になる:</p>

<pre id='e2d1'><code>2.1) le klama
    the comer, that which comes</code></pre>

<pre id='e2d2'><code>2.2) le se klama
    the destination</code></pre>

<pre id='e2d3'><code>2.3)   le te klama
    the origin</code></pre>

<pre id='e2d4'><code>2.4)   le ve klama
    the route</code></pre>

<pre id='e2d5'><code>2.5)   le xe klama
    the means of transportation</code></pre>

<pre id='e2d6'><code>2.6)   le nu klama
    the event of someone coming to somewhere
      from somewhere by some route using some means</code></pre>

<p>Examples 2.1 through <a href='#e2d5'>2.5</a> are descriptions that isolate the five individual sumti places of the selbri &#8221;klama&#8221;. <a href='#e2d6'>Example 2.6</a> describes something associated with the bridi as a whole: the event of it.</p>

<p>In ロジバン, the term &#8221;event&#8221; is divorced from its ordinary English sense of something that happens over a short period of time. The description:</p>

<pre id='e2d7'><code>2.7)  le nu mi vasxu
    the event-of my breathing</code></pre>

<p>is an event which lasts for the whole of my life (under normal circumstances). On the other hand,</p>

<pre id='e2d8'><code>2.8)  le nu la djan. cinba la djein.
    the event-of John kissing Jane</code></pre>

<p>is relatively brief by comparison (again, under normal circumstances).</p>

<p>We can see from <a href='#e2d6'>Examples 2.6</a> through <a href='#e2d8'>2.8</a> that ellipsis of sumti is valid in the bridi of abstraction selbri, just as in the main bridi of a sentence. Any sumti may be ellipsized if the listener will be able to figure out from context what the proper value of it is, or else to recognize that the proper value is unimportant. It is extremely common for &#8221;nu&#8221; abstractions in descriptions to have the x1 place ellipsized:</p>

<pre id='e2d9'><code>2.9)  mi nelci le nu limna
    I like the event-of swimming.
    I like swimming.</code></pre>

<p>is elliptical, and most probably means:</p>

<pre id='e2d10'><code>2.10)    mi nelci le nu mi limna
    I like the event-of I swim.</code></pre>

<p>In the proper context, of course, <a href='#e2d9'>Example 2.9</a> could refer to the event of somebody else swimming. Its English equivalent, &#8221;I like swimming&#8221;, can&#8217;t be interpreted as &#8221;I like Frank&#8217;s swimming&#8221;; this is a fundamental distinction between English and ロジバン. In ロジバン, an omitted sumti can mean whatever the context indicates that it should mean.</p>

<p>Note that the lack of an explicit NU cmavo in a sumti can sometimes hide an implicit abstraction. In the context of <a href='#e2d10'>Example 2.10</a>, the appearance of &#8221;le se nelci&#8221; (&#8221;that which is liked&#8221;) is in effect an abstraction:</p>

<pre id='e2d11'><code>2.11)    le se nelci cu cafne
    The liked-thing is-frequent.
    The thing which I like happens often.</code></pre>

<p>which in this context means</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My swimming happens often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Event descriptions with &#8221;le nu&#8221; are commonly used to fill the &#8221;under conditions&#8230;&#8221; places, among others, of gismu and lujvo place structures:</p>

<p id='e2d12'>2.12) la lojban. cu frili mi le nu mi tadni <span>kei</span> ロジバン is-easy for-me under-conditions-the event-of I study ロジバン is easy for me when I study.</p>

<p>(The &#8221;when&#8221; of the English would also be appropriate for a construction involving a ロジバン tense, but the ロジバン sentence says more than that the studying is concurrent with the ease.)</p>

<p>The place structure of a &#8221;nu&#8221; abstraction selbri is simply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x1 is an event of (the bridi)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id='s3'>3. 出来事の様々な側面を抽象化する</h3>

<p>この節では以下のシマヴォを解説する:</p>

<pre><code>   mu&#39;e    NU  瞬間的出来事の抽象詞
    pu&#39;u    NU  過程の抽象詞
    zu&#39;o    NU  活動の抽象詞
    za&#39;i    NU  状態の抽象詞</code></pre>

<p>Event abstractions with &#8221;nu&#8221; suffice to express all kinds of events, whether long, short, unique, repetitive, or whatever. ロジバン also has more finely discriminating machinery for talking about events, however. There are four other abstractors of selma&#8217;o NU for talking about four specific types of events, or four ways of looking at the same event.</p>

<p>An event considered as a point in time is called a &#8221;point-event&#8221;, or sometimes an &#8221;achievement&#8221;. (This latter word should be divorced, in this context, from all connotations of success or triumph.) A point-event can be extended in duration, but it is still a point-event if it is thought of as unitary, having no internal structure. The abstractor &#8221;mu&#8217;e&#8221; means &#8221;point-event-of&#8221;:</p>

<pre id='e3d1'><code>3.1)  le mu&#39;e la djan. catra la djim. cu zekri
    the point-event-of (John kills Jim) is-a-crime
    John&#39;s killing Jim (considered as a point in time)
        is a crime.</code></pre>

<p>An event considered as extended in time, and structured with a beginning, a middle containing one or more stages, and an end, is called a &#8221;process&#8221;. The abstractor &#8221;pu&#8217;u&#8221; means &#8221;process-of&#8221;:</p>

<pre id='e3d2'><code>3.2)  ca&#39;o le pu&#39;u le latmo balje&#39;a
        cu porpi kei
        so&#39;i je&#39;atru cu selcatra
    [continuitive] the process-of( the Latin great-state
        breaking-up )
        many state-rulers were-killed
    During the fall of the Roman Empire,
        many Emperors were killed.</code></pre>

<p>An event considered as extended in time and cyclic or repetitive is called an &#8221;activity&#8221;. The abstractor &#8221;zu&#8217;o&#8221; means &#8221;activity-of&#8221;:</p>

<pre id='e3d3'><code>3.3)  mi tatpi ri&#39;a le zu&#39;o mi plipe
    I am-tired because-of the activity-of (I jump)
    I am tired because I jump.</code></pre>

<p>An event considered as something that is either happening or not happening, with sharp boundaries, is called a &#8221;state&#8221;. The abstractor &#8221;za&#8217;i&#8221; means &#8221;state-of&#8221;:</p>

<pre id='e3d4'><code>3.4)  le za&#39;i mi jmive cu ckape do
    the state-of (I am-alive) is-dangerous-to you
    My being alive is dangerous to you.</code></pre>

<p>The abstractors in <a href='#e3d1'>Examples 3.1</a> through <a href='#e3d4'>3.4</a> could all have been replaced by &#8221;nu&#8221;, with some loss of precision. Note that ロジバン allows every sort of event to be viewed in any of these four ways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the &#8221;state of running&#8221; begins when the runner starts and ends when the runner stops;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>the &#8221;activity of running&#8221; consists of the cycle &#8221;lift leg, step forward, drop leg, lift other leg&#8230;&#8221; (each such cycle is a process, but the activity consists in the repetition of the cycle);</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>the &#8221;process of running&#8221; puts emphasis on the initial sprint, the steady speed, and the final slowdown;&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>the &#8221;achievement of running&#8221; is most alien to English, but sees the event of running as a single indivisible thing, like &#8221;Pheidippides&#8217; run from Marathon to Athens&#8221; (the original marathon).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further information on types of events can be found in <a href='#s12'>Section 12</a>.</p>

<p>The four event type abstractors have the following place structures:</p>

<dl>
<dt>&#8221;mu&#8217;e&#8221;</dt>

<dd>x1 is a point event of (the bridi)</dd>

<dt>&#8221;pu&#8217;u&#8221;</dt>

<dd>x1 is a process of (the bridi) with stages x2</dd>

<dt>&#8221;za&#8217;i&#8221;</dt>

<dd>x1 is a continuous state of (the bridi) being true</dd>

<dt>&#8221;zu&#8217;o&#8221;</dt>

<dd>x1 is an activity of (the bridi) consisting of repeated actions x2</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id='s4'>4. 属性の抽象化</h3>

<p>この節では以下のシマヴォを解説する:</p>

<pre><code>   ka  NU  属性の抽象詞
    ce&#39;u    KOhA    </code></pre>

<p>The things described by &#8221;le nu&#8221; descriptions (or, to put it another way, the things of which &#8221;nu&#8221; selbri may correctly be predicated) are only moderately &#8221;abstract&#8221;. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time. Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is &#8221;the property of being blue&#8221;, or &#8221;the property of being a go-er&#8221;? They are what logicians call &#8221;intensions&#8221;. If John has a heart, then &#8221;the property of having a heart&#8221; is an abstract object which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,</p>

<pre id='e4d1'><code>4.1)  la djan. cu se risna zo&#39;e
    John has-as-heart something-unspecified.
    John has a heart.</code></pre>

<p>has the same truth conditions as</p>

<pre id='e4d2'><code>4.2)  la djan. cu ckaji
        le ka se risna [zo&#39;e] [kei]
    John has-the-property
        the property-of having-as-heart something.
    John has the property of having a heart.</code></pre>

<p>(The English word &#8221;have&#8221; frequently appears in any discussion of ロジバン properties: things are said to &#8221;have&#8221; properties, but this is not the same sense of &#8221;have&#8221; as in &#8221;I have money&#8221;, which is possession.)</p>

<p>Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in brivla place structures:</p>

<pre id='e4d3'><code>4.3)  do cnino mi
        le ka xunre [kei]
    You are-new to-me
        in-the-quality-of-the property-of being-red.
    You are new to me in redness.</code></pre>

<p>(The English suffix &#8221;-ness&#8221; often signals a property abstraction, as does the suffix &#8221;-ity&#8221;.)</p>

<p>We can also move the property description to the x1 place of <a href='#e4d3'>Example 4.3</a>, producing:</p>

<pre id='e4d4'><code>4.4)  le ka do xunre [kei] cu cnino mi
    The property-of your being-red is-new to me.
    Your redness is new to me.</code></pre>

<p>It would be suitable to use <a href='#e4d3'>Examples 4.3</a> and <a href='#e4d4'>4.4</a> to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.</p>

<p>There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi, depending on which place of the bridi is &#8221;understood&#8221; as being specified externally. Thus:</p>

<pre id='e4d5'><code>4.5)  ka mi prami [zo&#39;e] [kei]
    a-property-of me loving something-unspecified</code></pre>

<p>is quite different from</p>

<pre id='e4d6'><code>4.6)  ka [zo&#39;e] prami mi [kei]
    a-property-of something-unspecified loving me</code></pre>

<p>In particular, sentences like <a href='#e4d7'>Example 4.7</a> and <a href='#e4d8'>Example 4.8</a> are quite different in meaning:</p>

<pre id='e4d7'><code>4.7)  la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka mi prami
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (I love X)
    I love John more than I love George.</code></pre>

<pre id='e4d8'><code>4.8)   la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka prami mi
    John exceeds George in the property of (X loves me).
    John loves me more than George loves me.</code></pre>

<p>The &#8221;X&#8221; used in the glosses of <a href='#e4d7'>Examples 4.7</a> through <a href='#e4d8'>4.8</a> as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in ロジバン, because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the ellipsis, as mentioned in <a href='#s2'>Section 2</a>. Instead, the cmavo &#8221;ce&#8217;u&#8221; of selma&#8217;o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form &#8221;X&#8221; will be used in literal translations.)</p>

<p>Therefore, an explicit equivalent of <a href='#e4d7'>Example 4.7</a>, with no ellipsis, is:</p>

<pre id='e4d9'><code>4.9)  la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka mi prami ce&#39;u
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (I love X).</code></pre>

<p>and of <a href='#e4d8'>Example 4.8</a> is:</p>

<pre id='e4d10'><code>4.10)    la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka ce&#39;u prami mi
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (X loves me).</code></pre>

<p>This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:</p>

<pre id='e4d11'><code>4.11)    le ka [zo&#39;e] dunda le xirma [zo&#39;e] [kei]
    the property-of giving the horse</code></pre>

<p>into</p>

<pre id='e4d12'><code>4.12)    le ka ce&#39;u dunda le xirma
        [zo&#39;e] [kei]
    the property-of (X is-a-giver of-the horse
        to someone-unspecified)
    the property of being a giver of the horse</code></pre>

<p>which is the most natural interpretation of <a href='#e4d11'>Example 4.11</a>, versus</p>

<pre id='e4d13'><code>4.13)    le ka [zo&#39;e] dunda
        le xirma ce&#39;u [kei]
    the property-of (someone-unspecified
        is-a-giver of-the horse to X)
    the property of being one to whom the horse is given</code></pre>

<p>which is also a possible interpretation.</p>

<p>It is also possible to have more than one &#8221;ce&#8217;u&#8221; in a &#8221;ka&#8221; abstraction, which transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction, a resource of the language that has not yet been explored.</p>

<p>The place structure of &#8221;ka&#8221; abstraction selbri is simply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x1 is a property of (the bridi)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id='s5'>5. 量の抽象化</h3>

<p>この節では以下のシマヴォを解説する:</p>

<pre><code>   ni  NU  amount abstraction</code></pre>

<p>Amount abstractions are far more limited than event or property abstractions. They really make sense only if the selbri of the abstracted bridi is subject to measurement of some sort. Thus we can speak of:</p>

<pre id='e5d1'><code>5.1)  le ni le pixra cu blanu [kei]
    the amount-of (the picture being-blue)
    the amount of blueness in the picture</code></pre>

<p>because &#8221;blueness&#8221; could be measured with a colorimeter or a similar device. However,</p>

<pre id='e5d2'><code>5.2)  le ni la djein. cu mamta [kei]
    the amount-of (Jane being-a-mother)
    the amount of Jane&#39;s mother-ness (?)
    the amount of mother-ness in Jane (?)</code></pre>

<p>makes very little sense in either ロジバン or English. We simply do not have any sort of measurement scale for being a mother.</p>

<p>Semantically, a sumti with &#8221;le ni&#8221; is a number; however, it cannot be treated grammatically as a quantifier in ロジバン unless prefixed by the mathematical cmavo &#8221;mo&#8217;e&#8221;:</p>

<pre id='e5d3'><code>5.3)  li pa vu&#39;u mo&#39;e
        le ni le pixra cu blanu [kei]
    the-number 1 minus the-operand
        the amount-of (the picture being-blue)
    1 - B, where B = blueness of the picture</code></pre>

<p>Mathematical ロジバン is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is explained more fully in <a href='chapter18.html'>Chapter
18</a>.</p>

<p>There are contexts where either property or amount abstractions make sense, and in such constructions, amount abstractions can make use of &#8221;ce&#8217;u&#8221; just like property abstractors. Thus,</p>

<pre id='e5d4'><code>5.4)  le pixra cu cenba le ka ce&#39;u blanu [kei]
    the picture varies in-the property-of (X is blue)
    The picture varies in being blue.
    The picture varies in blueness.</code></pre>

<p>is not the same as</p>

<pre id='e5d5'><code>5.5)  le pixra cu cenba le ni ce&#39;u blanu [kei]
    the picture varies in-the amount-of (X is blue)
    The picture varies in how blue it is.
    The picture varies in blueness.</code></pre>

<p><a href='#e5d4'>Example 5.4</a> conveys that the blueness comes and goes, whereas <a href='#e5d5'>Example 5.5</a> conveys that its quantity changes over time.</p>

<p>Whenever we talk of measurement of an amount, there is some sort of scale, and so the place structure of &#8221;ni&#8221; abstraction selbri is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: the best way to express the x2 places of abstract sumti is to use something like &#8221;le ni &#8230; kei be&#8221;. See <a href='#e9d5'>Example 9.5</a> for the use of this construction.</p>

<h3 id='s6'>6. truth_value(?)の抽象化: jei</h3>

<p>The &#8221;blueness of the picture&#8221; discussed in <a href='#s5'>Section 5</a> refers to the measurable amount of blue pigment (or other source of blueness), not to the degree of truth of the claim that blueness is present. That abstraction is expressed in ロジバン using &#8221;jei&#8221;, which is closely related semantically to &#8221;ni&#8221;. In the simplest cases, &#8221;le jei&#8221; produces not a number but a truth value:</p>

<pre id='e6d1'><code>6.1)  le jei li re su&#39;i re du li vo [kei]
    the truth-value-of the-number 2 + 2 = the-number 4
    the truth of 2 + 2 being 4</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to &#8221;truth&#8221;, and</p>

<pre id='e6d2'><code>6.2)  le jei li re su&#39;i re du li mu [kei]
    the truth-value-of the-number 2 + 2 = the-number 5
    the truth of 2 + 2 being 5</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to &#8221;falsehood&#8221;.</p>

<p>However, not everything in life (or even in ロジバン) is simply true or false. There are shades of gray even in truth value, and &#8221;jei&#8221; is ロジバン&#8217;s mechanism for indicating the shade of grey intended:</p>

<pre id='e6d3'><code>6.3)  mi ba jdice le jei
        la djordj. cu zekri gasnu [kei]
    I [future] decide the truth-value of
        (George being-a-(crime doer)).
    I will decide whether George is a criminal.</code></pre>

<p><a href='#e6d3'>Example 6.3</a> does not imply that George is, or is not, definitely a criminal. Depending on the legal system I am using, I may make some intermediate decision. As a result, &#8221;jei&#8221; requires an x2 place analogous to that of &#8221;ni&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x1 is the truth value of (the bridi) under epistemology x2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abstractions using &#8221;jei&#8221; are the mechanism for fuzzy logic in ロジバン; the &#8221;jei&#8221; abstraction refers to a number between 0 and 1 inclusive (as distinct from &#8221;ni&#8221; abstractions, which are often on open-ended scales). The detailed conventions for using &#8221;jei&#8221; in fuzzy-logic contexts have not yet been established.</p>

<h3 id='s7'>7. 断言/文の抽象化</h3>

<p>この節では以下のシマヴォを解説する:</p>

<pre><code>   du&#39;u    NU  predication abstraction</code></pre>

<p>There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call these the &#8221;propositional attitudes&#8221;, and they include (in English) things like knowing, believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:</p>

<pre id='e7d1'><code>7.1)  I know that Frank is a fool.</code></pre>

<p>How&#8217;s that in ロジバン? Let us try:</p>

<pre id='e7d2'><code>7.2)  mi djuno le nu la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I know the event of Frank being a fool.</code></pre>

<p>Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can&#8217;t be contained inside one&#8217;s mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like; <a href='#e7d2'>Example 7.2</a> comes close to claiming that Frank&#8217;s being-a-fool is purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, <a href='#e7d2'>Example 7.2</a> is an instance of improperly marked &#8221;sumti raising&#8221;, a concept discussed further in <a href='#s10'>Section 10</a>).</p>

<p>Try again:</p>

<pre id='e7d3'><code>7.3)  mi djuno le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.</code></pre>

<p>Closer. <a href='#e7d3'>Example 7.3</a> says that I know whether or not Frank is a fool, but doesn&#8217;t say that he is one, as <a href='#e7d1'>Example 7.1</a> does. To catch that nuance, we must say:</p>

<pre id='e7d4'><code>7.4)  mi djuno le du&#39;u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I know the predication that Frank is a fool.</code></pre>

<p>Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion &#8221;Frank is a fool&#8221; is not a property of &#8221;le du&#8217;u&#8221; abstraction, but of &#8221;djuno&#8221;; we can only know what is in fact true. (As a result, &#8221;djuno&#8221; like &#8221;jei&#8221; has a place for epistemology, which specifies how we know.) <a href='#e7d5'>Example 7.5</a> has no such implied assertion:</p>

<pre id='e7d5'><code>7.5)  mi kucli le du&#39;u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.</code></pre>

<p>and here &#8221;du&#8217;u&#8221; could probably be replaced by &#8221;jei&#8221; without much change in meaning:</p>

<pre id='e7d6'><code>7.6)  mi kucli le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I am curious about how true it is
        that Frank is a fool.</code></pre>

<p>As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, &#8221;du&#8217;u&#8221; has been given an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and &#8221;le se du&#8217;u &#8230;&#8221; is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to speaking, writing, or other linguistic behavior regarding bridi:</p>

<pre id='e7d6.5'><code>7.6.5)  la djan. cusku
        le se du&#39;u
            la djordj. klama le zarci [kei]
    John expresses
        the sentence-expressing-that
            George goes-to the store
    John says that George goes to the store.</code></pre>

<p><a href='#e7d6'>Example 7.6</a> differs from</p>

<pre id='e7d7'><code>7.7)  la djan cusku
        lu la djordj. klama le zarci li&#39;u
    John expresses,
        quote, George goes to the store, unquote.
    John says &#39;&#39;George goes to the store&#39;&#39;.</code></pre>

<p>because <a href='#e7d7'>Example 7.7</a> claims that John actually said the quoted words, whereas <a href='#e7d6'>Example 7.6</a> claims only that he said some words or other which were to the same purpose.</p>

<p>&#8221;le se du&#8217;u&#8221; is much the same as &#8221;lu&#8217;e le du&#8217;u&#8221;, a symbol for the predication, but &#8221;se du&#8217;u&#8221; can be used as a selbri, whereas &#8221;lu&#8217;e&#8221; is ungrammatical in a selbri. (See <a href='chapter5.html'>Chapter 5</a> for a discussion of &#8221;lu&#8217;e&#8221;.)</p>

<h3 id='s8'>8. 遠回しの質問</h3>

<p>この節では以下のシマヴォを解説する:</p>

<pre><code>   kau UI  indirect question marker</code></pre>

<p>There is an alternative type of sentence involving &#8221;du&#8217;u&#8221; and a selbri expressing a propositional attitude. In addition to sentences like</p>

<pre id='e8d1'><code>8.1)  I know that John went to the store.</code></pre>

<p>we can also say things like</p>

<pre id='e8d2'><code>8.2)  I know who went to the store.</code></pre>

<p>This form is called an &#8221;indirect question&#8221; in English because the embedded English sentence is a question: &#8221;Who went to the store?&#8221; A person who says <a href='#e8d2'>Example 8.2</a> is claiming to know the answer to this question. Indirect questions can occur with many other English verbs as well: I can wonder, or doubt, or see, or hear, as well as know who went to the store.</p>

<p>To express indirect questions in ロジバン, we use a &#8221;le du&#8217;u&#8221; abstraction, but rather than using a question word like &#8221;who&#8221; (&#8221;ma&#8221; in ロジバン), we use any word that will fit grammatically and mark it with the suffix particle &#8221;kau&#8221;. This cmavo belongs to selma&#8217;o UI, so grammatically it can appear anywhere. The simplest ロジバン translation of <a href='#e8d2'>Example 8.2</a> is therefore:</p>

<pre id='e8d3'><code>8.3)  mi djuno le du&#39;u
        makau pu klama le zarci
    I know the predication-of
        X [indirect question] [past] going to the store.</code></pre>

<p>In <a href='#e8d3'>Example 8.3</a>, we have chosen to use &#8221;ma&#8221; as the word marked by &#8221;kau&#8221;. In fact, any other sumti would have done as well: &#8221;zo&#8217;e&#8221; or &#8221;da&#8221; or even &#8221;la djan.&#8221;. Using &#8221;la djan.&#8221; would suggest that it was John who I knew had gone to the store, however:</p>

<pre id='e8d4'><code>8.4)  mi djuno le du&#39;u
        la djan. kau pu
            klama le zarci
    I know the predication-of/fact-that
        John [indirect question] [past]
            going to the store.
    I know who went to the store, namely John.
    I know that it was John who went to the store.</code></pre>

<p>Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as &#8221;ma&#8221;, &#8221;zo&#8217;e&#8221;, or &#8221;da&#8221; does not suggest any particular value.</p>

<p>Why does ロジバン require the &#8221;kau&#8221; marker, rather than using &#8221;ma&#8221; as English and Chinese and many other languages do? Because &#8221;ma&#8221; always signals a direct question, and so</p>

<pre id='e8d5'><code>8.5)  mi djuno le du&#39;u
        ma pu klama le zarci
    I know the predication-of
        [what sumti?] [past] goes-to the store</code></pre>

<p>means</p>

<pre id='e8d6'><code>8.6)  Who is it that I know goes to the store?</code></pre>

<p>It is actually not necessary to use &#8221;le du&#8217;u&#8221; and &#8221;kau&#8221; at all if the indirect question involves a sumti; there is generally a paraphrase of the type:</p>

<pre id='e8d7'><code>8.7)  mi djuno fi le pu klama be le zarci
    I know about the [past] goer to-the store.
    I know something about the one who went to the store
        (namely, his identity).</code></pre>

<p>because the x3 place of &#8221;djuno&#8221; is the subject of knowledge, as opposed to the fact that is known. But when the questioned point is not a sumti, but (say) a logical connection, then there is no good alternative to &#8221;kau&#8221;:</p>

<pre id='e8d8'><code>8.8)  mi ba zgana le du&#39;u
        la djan. jikau la djordj.
            cu zvati le panka
    I [future] observe the predication-of/fact-that
        John [connective indirect question] George
            is-at the park.
    I will see whether John or George (or both)
        is at the park.</code></pre>

<p>In addition, <a href='#e8d7'>Example 8.7</a> is only a loose paraphrase of <a href='#e8d3'>Example 8.3</a>, because it is left to the listener&#8217;s insight to realize that what is known about the goer-to-the-store is his identity rather than some other of his attributes.</p>

<h3 id='s9'>9. あまり使われない抽象化</h3>

<p>この節では以下のシマヴォを解説する:</p>

<pre><code>   li&#39;i    NU  experience abstractor
    si&#39;o    NU  concept abstractor
    su&#39;u    NU  general abstractor</code></pre>

<p>There are three more abstractors in ロジバン, all of them little used so far. The abstractor &#8221;li&#8217;i&#8221; expresses experience:</p>

<pre id='e9d1'><code>9.1)  mi morji le li&#39;i mi verba
    I remember the experience-of (my being-a-child)</code></pre>

<p>The abstractor &#8221;si&#8217;o&#8221; expresses a mental image, a concept, an idea:</p>

<pre id='e9d2'><code>9.2)  mi nelci le si&#39;o la lojban. cu mulno
    I enjoy the concept-of ロジバン being-complete.</code></pre>

<p>Finally, the abstractor &#8221;su&#8217;u&#8221; is a vague abstractor, whose meaning must be grasped from context:</p>

<pre id='e9d3'><code>9.3)  ko zgana le su&#39;u
        le ci smacu cu bajra
    you [imperative] observe the abstract-nature-of
        the three mice running
    See how the three mice run!</code></pre>

<p>All three of these abstractors have an x2 place. An experience requires an experiencer, so the place structure of &#8221;li&#8217;i&#8221; is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x1 is the experience of (the bridi) as experienced by x2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, an idea requires a mind to hold it, so the place structure of &#8221;si&#8217;o&#8221; is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x1 is the idea/concept of (the bridi) in the mind of x2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, there needs to be some way of specifying just what sort of abstraction &#8221;su&#8217;u&#8221; is representing, so its place structure is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x1 is an abstract nature of (the bridi) of type x2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The x2 place of &#8221;su&#8217;u&#8221; allows it to serve as a substitute for any of the other abstractors, or as a template for creating new ones. For example,</p>

<pre id='e9d4'><code>9.4)  le nu mi klama
    the event-of my going</code></pre>

<p>can be paraphrased as</p>

<pre id='e9d5'><code>9.5)  le su&#39;u mi klama kei be lo fasnu
    the abstract-nature-of (my going) of-type an event</code></pre>

<p>and there is a book whose title might be rendered in ロジバン as:</p>

<pre id='e9d6'><code>9.6)  le su&#39;u la .iecuas. kuctra
        selcatra kei
        be lo sao&#39;rdzifa&#39;a
        ke nalmatma&#39;e sutyterjvi
    the abstract-nature-of (Jesus is-an-intersect-shape
        type-of-killed-one)
        of-type a slope-low-direction
        type-of non-motor-vehicle speed-competition
    The Crucifixion of Jesus Considered As A
        Downhill Bicycle Race</code></pre>

<p>Note the importance of using &#8221;kei&#8221; after &#8221;su&#8217;u&#8221; when the x2 of &#8221;su&#8217;u&#8221; (or any other abstractor) is being specified; otherwise, the &#8221;be lo&#8221; ends up inside the abstraction bridi.</p>

<h3 id='s10'>10. ロジバンのスムティ昇格の仕組み</h3>

<p>この節では以下のシマヴォを解説する:</p>

<pre><code>   tu&#39;a    LAhE    an abstraction involving
    jai JAI abstraction conversion</code></pre>

<p>It is sometimes inconvenient, in a situation where an abstract description is logically required, to express the abstraction. In English we can say:</p>

<pre id='e10d1'><code>10.1)    I try to open the door.</code></pre>

<p>which in ロジバン is:</p>

<pre id='e10d2'><code>10.2)    mi troci le nu
        [mi] gasnu le nu
            le vorme cu karbi&#39;o
    I try the event-of
        (I am-agent-in the event-of
            (the door open-becomes)).</code></pre>

<p>which has an abstract description within an abstract description, quite a complex structure. In English (but not in all other languages), we may also say:</p>

<pre id='e10d3'><code>10.3)    I try the door.</code></pre>

<p>where it is understood that what I try is actually not the door itself, but the act of opening it. The same simplification can be done in ロジバン, but it must be marked explicitly using a cmavo. The relevant cmavo is &#8221;tu&#8217;a&#8221;, which belongs to selma&#8217;o LAhE. The ロジバン equivalent of <a href='#e10d3'>Example 10.3</a> is:</p>

<pre id='e10d4'><code>10.4)    mi troci tu&#39;a le vorme
    I try some-action-to-do-with the door.</code></pre>

<p>The term &#8221;sumti-raising&#8221;, as in the title of this section, signifies that a sumti which logically belongs within an abstraction (or even within an abstraction which is itself inside an intermediate abstraction) is &#8221;raised&#8221; to the main bridi level. This transformation from <a href='#e10d2'>Example 10.2</a> to <a href='#e10d4'>Example 10.4</a> loses information: nothing except convention tells us what the abstraction was.</p>

<p>Using &#8221;tu&#8217;a&#8221; is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking easier at the possible expense of clarity for the listener. The speaker must be prepared for the listener to respond something like:</p>

<pre id='e10d5'><code>10.5)    tu&#39;a le vorme lu&#39;u ki&#39;a
    something-to-do-with the door [terminator] [confusion!]</code></pre>

<p>which indicates that &#8221;tu&#8217;a le vorme&#8221; cannot be understood. (The terminator for &#8221;tu&#8217;a&#8221; is &#8221;lu&#8217;u&#8221;, and is used in <a href='#e10d5'>Example 10.5</a> to make clear just what is being questioned: the sumti-raising, rather than the word &#8221;vorme&#8221; as such.) An example of a confusing raised sumti might be:</p>

<pre id='e10d6'><code>10.6)    tu&#39;a la djan. cu cafne
    something-to-do-with John frequently-occurs</code></pre>

<p>This must mean that something which John does, or which happens to John, occurs frequently: but without more context there is no way to figure out what. Note that without the &#8221;tu&#8217;a&#8221;, <a href='#e10d6'>Example 10.6</a> would mean that John considered as an event frequently occurs &#8212; in other words, that John has some sort of on-and-off existence! Normally we do not think of people as events in English, but the x1 place of &#8221;cafne&#8221; is an event, and if something that does not seem to be an event is put there, the ロジバンic listener will attempt to construe it as one. (Of course, this analysis assumes that &#8221;djan.&#8221; is the name of a person, and not the name of some event.)</p>

<p>Logically, a counterpart of some sort is needed to &#8221;tu&#8217;a&#8221; which transposes an abstract sumti into a concrete one. This is achieved at the selbri level by the cmavo &#8221;jai&#8221; (of selma&#8217;o JAI). This cmavo has more than one function, discussed in <a href='chapter9.html'>Chapter 9</a> and <a href='chapter11.html'>Chapter 11</a>; for the purposes of this chapter, it operates as a conversion of selbri, similarly to the cmavo of selma&#8217;o SE. This conversion changes</p>

<pre id='e10d7'><code>10.7)    tu&#39;a mi rinka
        le nu do morsi
    something-to-do-with me causes
        the event-of you are-dead
    My action causes your death.</code></pre>

<pre id='e10d8'><code>into 

10.8)    mi jai rinka le nu do morsi
    I am-associated-with causing the event-of your death.
    I cause your death.</code></pre>

<p>In English, the subject of &#8221;cause&#8221; can either be the actual cause (an event), or else the agent of the cause (a person, typically); not so in ロジバン, where the x1 of &#8221;rinka&#8221; is always an event. <a href='#e10d7'>Example 10.7</a> and <a href='#e10d8'>Example 10.8</a> look equally convenient (or inconvenient), but in making descriptions, <a href='#e10d8'>Example 10.8</a> can be altered to:</p>

<pre id='e10d9'><code>10.9)    le jai rinka
        be le nu do morsi
    that-which-is associated-with causing
        (the event-of your death)
    the one who caused your death</code></pre>

<p>because &#8221;jai&#8221; modifies the selbri and can be incorporated into the description &#8212; not so for &#8221;tu&#8217;a&#8221;.</p>

<p>The weakness of &#8221;jai&#8221; used in descriptions in this way is that it does not specify which argument of the implicit abstraction is being raised into the x1 place of the description selbri. One can be more specific by using the modal form of &#8221;jai&#8221; explained in <a href='chapter9.html'>Chapter 9</a>:</p>

<pre id='e10d10'><code>10.10)  le jai gau rinka
        be le nu do morsi
    that-which-is agent-in causing
        (the event-of your death)</code></pre>

<h3 id='s11'>11. 出来事系抽象詞と事象線の間制</h3>

<p>This section is a logical continuation of <a href='#s3'>Section 3</a>.</p>

<p>There exists a relationship between the four types of events explained in <a href='#s3'>Section 3</a> and the event contour tense cmavo of selma&#8217;o ZAhO. The specific cmavo of NU and of ZAhO are mutually interdefining; the ZAhO contours were chosen to fit the needs of the NU event types and vice versa. Event contours are explained in full in <a href='chapter10.html'>Chapter
10</a>, and only summarized here.</p>

<p>The purpose of ZAhO cmavo is to represent the natural portions of an event, such as the beginning, the middle, and the end. They fall into several groups:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cmavo &#8221;pu&#8217;o&#8221;, &#8221;ca&#8217;o&#8221;, and &#8221;ba&#8217;o&#8221; represent spans of time: before an event begins, while it is going on, and after it is over, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The cmavo &#8221;co&#8217;a&#8221;, &#8221;de&#8217;a&#8221;, &#8221;di&#8217;a&#8221;, and &#8221;co&#8217;u&#8221; represent points of time: the start of an event, the temporary stopping of an event, the resumption of an event after a stop, and the end of an event, respectively. Not all events can have breaks in them, in which case &#8221;de&#8217;a&#8221; and &#8221;di&#8217;a&#8221; do not apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The cmavo &#8221;mo&#8217;u&#8221; and &#8221;za&#8217;o&#8221; correspond to &#8221;co&#8217;u&#8221; and &#8221;ba&#8217;o&#8221; respectively, in the case of those events which have a natural ending point that may not be the same as the actual ending point: &#8221;mo&#8217;u&#8221; refers to the natural ending point, and &#8221;za&#8217;o&#8221; to the time between the natural ending point and the actual ending point (the &#8221;excessive&#8221; or &#8221;superfective&#8221; part of the event).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The cmavo &#8221;co&#8217;i&#8221; represents an entire event considered as a point-event or achievement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All these cmavo are applicable to events seen as processes and abstracted with &#8221;pu&#8217;u&#8221;. Only processes have enough internal structure to make all these points and spans of time meaningful.</p>

<p>For events seen as states and abstracted with &#8221;za&#8217;i&#8221;, the meaningful event contours are the spans &#8221;pu&#8217;o&#8221;, &#8221;ca&#8217;o&#8221;, and &#8221;ba&#8217;o&#8221;; the starting and ending points &#8221;co&#8217;a&#8221; and &#8221;co&#8217;u&#8221;, and the achievement contour &#8221;co&#8217;i&#8221;. States do not have natural endings distinct from their actual ending. (It is an open question whether states can be stopped and resumed.)</p>

<p>For events seen as activities and abstracted with &#8221;zu&#8217;o&#8221;, the meaningful event contours are the spans &#8221;pu&#8217;o&#8221;, &#8221;ca&#8217;o&#8221;, and &#8221;ba&#8217;o&#8221;, and the achievement contour &#8221;co&#8217;i&#8221;. Because activities are inherently cyclic and repetitive, the beginning and ending points are not well-defined: you do not know whether an activity has truly begun until it begins to repeat.</p>

<p>For events seen as point-events and abstracted with &#8221;mu&#8217;e&#8221;, the meaningful event contours are the spans &#8221;pu&#8217;o&#8221; and &#8221;ba&#8217;o&#8221; but not &#8221;ca&#8217;o&#8221; (a point-event has no duration), and the achievement contour &#8221;co&#8217;i&#8221;.</p>

<p>Note that the parts of events are themselves events, and may be treated as such. The points in time may be seen as &#8221;mu&#8217;e&#8221; point-events; the spans of time may constitute processes or activities. Therefore, ロジバン allows us to express processes within processes, activities within states, and many other complicated abstract things.</p>

The connection can be expanded to one between two bridi which differ only in abstraction marker. <a href='#e13d1'>Example 13.1</a> and <a href='#e13d2'>Example 13.2</a> are equivalent in meaning:</p>

<pre id='e13d1'><code>13.1)    le ka la frank. ciska cu xlali
