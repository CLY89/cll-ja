<paragraph>
Let us think about the problem of コミュニケーション <en>communicating</en>
what it is that we are pointing at something.
In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti ``ti"
if it is nearby, or ``ta" if it is somewhat further away, or ``tu" if it is
distant.
(Pro-sumti are explained in full in
<ln><name>Chapter7</name><address>./chapter7.html</address></ln>.)
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips,
or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture,
it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at.
Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or
her face), and says:
<example><ex_no>1.1</ex_no>
<lojban>ti cu barda</lojban>
<japanese>これは大きい。</japanese>
<en>This-one is-big.</en>
</example>
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
What is the referent of ``ti"? Is it the person?
Or perhaps it is the person's nose?
Or even (for ``ti" can be plural as well as singular,
and mean "these ones" as well as ``this one") the pores on the person's nose?
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a ``relative clause".
Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti,
but there are other places where they can go as well,
as explained later in this chapter.
A relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI,
and ends with the elidable terminator ``ku'o" (of selma'o KUhO).
As you might suppose, ``noi" is a cmavo of selma'o NOI;
however, first we will discuss the cmavo ``poi" which also belongs to selma'o NOI.
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
In between the ``poi" and the ``ku'o" appears a full bridi,
with the same syntax as any other bridi.
Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause,
the pro-sumti ``ke'a" (of selma'o KOhA) may be used,
and it stands for the sumti to which the relative clause is attached
(called the ``relativized sumti").
Here are some examples before we go any further:

<example><ex_no>1.2</ex_no>
<lojban>ti poi ke'a prenu ku'o cu barda</lojban>
<japanese>この人は大きい。</japanese>
<en>
This-thing such-that(IT is-a-person) is-large.
This thing which is a person is big.
This person is big.</en>
</example>

<example><ex_no>1.3</ex_no>
<lojban>ti poi ke'a nazbi ku'o cu barda</lojban>
<japanese>この鼻は大きい。</japanese>
<en>
This-thing such-that (IT is-a-nose) is-large.
This thing which is a nose is big.
This nose is big.
</en>
</example>

<example><ex_no>1.4</ex_no>
<lojban>ti poi ke'a nazbi kapkevna ku'o</lojban>
<japanese>これらの鼻の毛穴は大きい。</japanese>
<en>
This-thing such-that (IT is-a-nose-type-of skin-hole) is-big.
These things which are nose-pores are big.
These nose-pores are big.
</en>
</example>
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word ``IT",
capitalized, is used to represent the cmavo ``ke'a".
In each case, it serves to represent the sumti
(in <ln><name>Examples 1.2</name><address>#1.2</address></ln> through
<ln><name>1.4</name><address>#1.4</address></ln>, the cmavo ``ti") to which
the relative clause is attached.
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
Of course, there is no reasen why ``ke'a" needs to appear in the x1 place of
a relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place,
or indeed even in a sub-bridi within the relative clause bridi.
Here are two more examples:

<example><ex_no>1.5</ex_no>
<lojban>tu poi le mlatu pu lacpu ke'a ku'o cu ratcu</lojban>
<japanese></japanese>
<en>
That-distant-thing such-that (the cat [past] drags IT) is-a-rat.
That thing which the cat dragged is a rat.
What the cat dragged is a rat.
</en>
</example>

<example><ex_no>1.6</ex_no>
<lojban>ta poi mi djica le nu mi ponse ke'a [kei]
ku'o cu bloti</lojban>
<japanese></japanese>
<en>
That-thing such-that (I desire the event-of (I own IT)) is-a-boat.
That thing that I want to own is a boat.
</en>
</example>

</paragraph>

<paragraph>
In <ln><name>Example 1.6</name><address>#1.6</address></ln>,
"ke'a" appears in an abstraction clause
(abstractions are explained in
<ln><name>Chapter 11</name><address>./chapter11.html</address></ln>)
within a relative clause.
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
Like any sumti, ``ke'a" can be omitted.
The usual presumption in that case is that it then falls into the x1 place:

<example><ex_no>1.7</ex_no>
<lojban>ti poi nazbi cu barda</lojban>
<japanese></japanese>
<en>
This-thing which is-a-nose is-big.
</en>
</example>
almost certainly means the same thing as
<ln><name>Example 1.3</name><address>#1.3</address></ln>.
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
However, ``ke'a" can be ommitted if it is clear to the listener that it belongs
in some place other than x1:

<example><ex_no>1.8</ex_no>
<lojban>tu poi le mlatu pu lacpu cu ratcu</lojban>
<japanese></japanese>
<en>
That-distant-thing which the cat drags is-a-rat
</en>
</example>

is equivalent to <ln><name>Example 1.4</name><address>#1.4</address></ln>
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
As stated before, ``ku'o" is an elidable terminator,
and in fact it is almost always elidable.
Throughout the rest of this chapter,
``ku'o" will not be written in any of the examples unless it is absolutely
required: thus, <ln><name>Example 1.2</name><address>#1.2</address></ln>
can be written:

<example><ex_no>1.9</ex_no>
<lojban>ti poi prenu cu barda</lojban>
<japanese></japanese>
<en>
That which is-a-person is-big.
That person is big.
</en>
</example>
without any change in meaning.

</paragraph>

<paragraph>
Note that ``poi" is translated ``which" rather than ``such-that" when
``ke'a" has been ommitted from the x1 place of the relative clause bridi.
The word ``which" is used in English to introduce English relative clauses:
other words that can be used are ``who" and ``that", as in:

<example><ex_no>1.10</ex_no>
<english>I saw a man who was going to the store.</english>
<japanese></japanese>
</example>

and

<example><ex_no>1.11</ex_no>
<english>The building that the school was located in is large.</english>
<japanese></japanese>
</example>
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
In <ln><name>Example 1.10</name><address>#1.10</address></ln> the relative clause is
``who was going to the store",
and in <ln><name>Example 1.11</name><address>#1.11</address></ln> it is
``that the school was located in".
Sometimes ``who", ``which" and ``that" are used in literal translations in this
chapter in order to make them read more smoothly.
