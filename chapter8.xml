<paragraph>
Let us think about the problem of コミュニケーション <en>communicating</en>
what it is that we are pointing at something.
In Lojban, we can refer to what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti ``ti"
if it is nearby, or ``ta" if it is somewhat further away, or ``tu" if it is
distant.
(Pro-sumti are explained in full in
<ln><name>Chapter7</name><address>./chapter7.html</address></ln>.)
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips,
or whatever may be appropriate in the local culture,
it is often hard for a listener to tell just what is being pointed at.
Suppose one is pointing at a person (in particular, in the direction of his or
her face), and says:
<example><ex_no>1.1</ex_no>
<lojban>ti cu barda</lojban>
<japanese>これは大きい。</japanese>
<en>This-one is-big.</en>
</example>
What is the referent of ``ti"? Is it the person?
Or perhaps it is the person's nose?
Or even (for ``ti" can be plural as well as singular,
and mean "these ones" as well as ``this one") the pores on the person's nose?

<paragraph>
To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a ``relative clause".
